# Mortgage Calculator

This was my first side project as a student at Tech Elevator.
This mortgage calculator console application was developed in Java and designed following OOP. 
For the variables representing monetary values, used Java BigDecimal.

This console application has the functionality to:

* Calculate a monthly mortgage payment based off the following input information: (home value, 
  down payment, interest rate, loan term, start date, PMI, property tax, home insurance, HOA)
* Displays a mortgage repayment summary listing:
    - the total monthly payment
    - the PMI rate
    - the down payment amount
    - the down payment percentage
    - the expected loan paid-off date
    - the monthly property tax payment
    - total property tax paid over the course of the loan term
    - the monthly home insurance payment
    - total home insurance paid over the course of the loan term
    - the annual mortgage payment amount
    - the total amount paid on the mortgage over the course of the loan term
* Calculates the amortization schedule, showing:
    - the month and year of each payment
    - the monthly mortgage payment
    - the portion of the payment going towards principal
    - the portion of the payment going towards interest
    - the total interest paid up until that point
    - the updated balance after each payment
